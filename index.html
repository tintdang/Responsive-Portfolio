                    <p>Hello! My name is Tin Dang and I am working to become an aspiring web developer. I grew up utilizing
                        computers for a very long time and finally decided to take the jump into web development. I originally
                        graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree of Social Work. After graduation,
                        I was doing sales at anime conventions for about a year and other odd jobs. But now it's time to
                        take things up a notch and jump into creating things that me or others imagine into reality! Thanks
                        for visiting by my website!
